General Notes Regarding Solutions to Assignment 1 (A1):

After all sections taking this course from me this semester have reached the due date for this assignment, I post a solution on my web site, accessible under the Assignments page at:

    http://www.gibsonr.com/classes/cop2000/assignments.html

I also post notes related to the assignment on the Angel discussion forum entitled "Instructor Notes to Students". You should read them and the comments below to see where your submitted documentation may have differed from the posted solution. Note that almost all problems have many possible solutions. I post only one solution for each assignment. Each student's solution will differ from mine to some extent, but can be equally correct. For analysis assignments, your approach might be quite different, in which case you will have to judge on your own whether your solution is equally effective. If you have questions, contact me.

Critique of Student Submission for Assignment 1:

The comments below reflect areas where you could improve your documentation to more clearly reflect an effective analysis. Remember that the purpose of these assignments is to give you practice and help you build new skills. Mistakes are part of that process and expected events. The critique below is intended to help you learn from this exercise and improve future work.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem statement should be just a "statement" (not an entire summary or outline). It should describe the objectives of the program and any special constraints, but should not describe "how" the program will work. The "how" is described in the algorithm document.

Although the use of a symbolic constant was required as part of this assignment, it was not part of the objectives of the program. So it did not need to be mentioned in the Problem Statement. It is sufficiently documented in the Symbolic Constant List.

You should not include programming language syntax such as setprecision(2) in an analysis document. The language should be chosen based on the results of the analysis. So inclusion of a specific language's sysntx could be confusing and counterproductive.

See the posted solution for a more typically statement.

SAMPLE OUTPUT - SOFTCOPY

You should include some notes to the reader indicating that the line numbers and brackets are not literal, but there to clarify the document. See the examples of this on my web site at:

     http://www.gibsonr.com/classes/cop2000/example_prob_solv.html

Your Sample Softcopy and following documentation should show the answers rounded to 2 decimal places.

SYMBOLIC CONSTANT LIST

Please review the example referenced in Assignment 1 and the posted solution and the A1 notes under the Instructor Notes to Students forum in the Angel Discussion forums that describe the proper six-column format for a Symbolic Constant List.

VARIABLE LIST

Please review the example referenced in Assignment 1 and the posted solution and the A1 notes under the Instructor Notes to Students forum in the Angel Discussion forums that describe the proper six-column format for a Variable List.

Did you really mean "otal" instead of "total"? Check you work more carefully.

ALGORITHM

Avoid using programming Language syntax (such as "\n") in logical documents (such as the algorithm). Often an analyst does not know which language will be used to code a program until after the analysis is complete. And sometimes programs are re-written in a language different from the one which was originally used. As such, it is best to use more generic, human notation in logic documents to avoid confusion in the future.

Symbolic constants are values, not storage locations. So they cannot have values assigned to them. They should simply be used in the algorithm as if they were a literal number.

An algorithm should contain a specifically stated start and end.

TRACING CHART (FROM DESK CHECK)

Look more closely at the columnar format of the Data Tracing Chart. Each variable is supposed to be given its own column.

TEST OUTPUT - SOFTCOPY (FROM DESK CHECK)

See the notes above for the Sample Softcopy.

SUMMARY

Don't be discouraged by these remarks. Mistakes are part of the learning process. Call me during my office hours if you have questions. Then review your work and revise it with these notes in mind and then resubmit it through the Angel drop box again  to complete the requirements for this assignment. If you submit the work within one week of this message, you will be awarded the bonus point for timely submission based on the date of your original submission.
