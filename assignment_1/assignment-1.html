<h1 id="problem-statement-really-high-level-instructions-for-the-computer">Problem Statement; really high-level instructions for the computer</h1>
<p>Program will send a message to the screen to greet user and introduce itself and ask the user for the length of the room, then store that number in storage location named L. It then asks for the width, storing that number in a location named W. Finally the program will ask for the price of the carpet in square yards, it will then divide that amount by 9, storing that in a location named P. All user inputs will be able to use two decimal places if necessary. The program will then multiply the length by the width and store this number in location SQFT. The program will then multiply the value in SQFT by the value in P, storing this value in a location named TotalCost. The program will display a message on screen stating that the total square footage of the room, and what the cost to carpet the room would be, rounded to two decimals. The program will lastly thank the user and display the program credits.</p>
