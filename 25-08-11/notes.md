# A FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING
  
(ANALYSIS - THE LOGICAL PART OF PROBLEM SOLVING:)  
  
I. Define the problem or task (WHY) and divide into modules if necessary.  
II. Define the data (WHAT).  
    A. Define the Output (WANTS).  
        1. Hardcopy (on paper).  
        2. Softcopy (on the screen)  
    B. Define the Input (INVESTMENT).  
III. Define the Algorithm (HOW).  
IV. Check the Algorithm (HUMILITY).

(PROGRAMMING - THE PHYSICAL PART OF PROBLEM SOLVING:)  
  
V. Code the Algorithm into a Computer Language (TRANSLATE).  
VI. Debug the Code (IMPLEMENT).
