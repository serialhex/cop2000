# A FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING
  
(ANALYSIS - THE LOGICAL PART OF PROBLEM SOLVING:)  
  
1. Define the problem or task (WHY) and divide into modules if necessary.  
2. Define the data (WHAT).  
    + Define the Output (WANTS).  
        * Hardcopy (on paper).  
        * Softcopy (on the screen)  
    + Define the Input (INVESTMENT).  
3. Define the Algorithm (HOW).  
4. Check the Algorithm (HUMILITY).  
_____________________________________________________
  
(PROGRAMMING - THE PHYSICAL PART OF PROBLEM SOLVING:)  
  
5. Code the Algorithm into a Computer Language (TRANSLATE).  
6. Debug the Code (IMPLEMENT).  
  
  
3 kinds of errors:
- syntax error
- logic error
- runtime error

pay attention to types of data that may be used!

when writing documentation & algorithms, write it from the computers point of view!
